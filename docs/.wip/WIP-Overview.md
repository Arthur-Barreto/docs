## Overview

The docs are currently under heavy construction. For starters, the following pages are going to be moved to the site:

- [RetroAchievements Manifesto](RetroAchievements-Manifesto)
- [Users Code of Conduct](Users-Code-of-Conduct)
- [Global Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules](Global-Leaderboard-and-Achievement-Hunting-Rules)
- [Developer's Code of Conduct](Developers-Code-of-Conduct)
- [Set Plagiarism](Set-Plagiarism)
- [Achievement Scoring](Achievement-Scoring)
- [Achievement Set Revisions](Achievement-Set-Revisions)
- [Achievements for ROM hacks](Achievements-for-ROM-hacks)
- [Subsets](Subsets)
- [Working with the Right ROM](Working-with-the-Right-ROM)
- [FAQ](FAQ)

The plan is to have any documentation involving guidelines/policy as well as a general FAQ be in plain sight on [retroachievements.org](https://retroachievements.org). Some of the pages will be merged and will result in the following categories:

- User Code of Conduct
- Global Leaderboard and Achievement Hunting Rules
- Developer Code of Conduct
- Content Guidelines
- General FAQ

This will eventually allow for the wiki to be more open and dedicated to support docs, tutorials, resources, etc.
