### When a member gets banned from the Discord server, are they automatically banned from the website?

No.

The member will still be able to use our services to play retrogames with achievements. But if the disruptive behavior continues on the website, they'll be banned from there too.

### I created a Discord server because I want more freedom than what I have on the official RetroAchievements server. Can I promote my server here?

### Is it mandatory for achievement creators to join the Discord server?

No.

Joining our Discord server is optional. But if you're in the list of banned users there, you cannot have the "Developer" role on the website.

### If an achievement creator is banned from Discord will they lose the "Developer" role on the website?

Yes.

### If I'm banned from the Discord server but I still want to create achievements, what should I do?

Send your appeal to [RAdmin](http://retroachievements.org/createmessage.php?t=RAdmin) or <ramodmail@gmail.com> to try and have your ban lifted.

It doesn't really matter if you want to join the server or not, if you're in the list of banned users in our Discord server, you cannot have the "Developer" role on the website.
